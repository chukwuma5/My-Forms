 # CREATION AND DESIGN OF A REGISRATION FORM (part-1)    

 # Welcome!

 Thank you for checking this work. 

 ##ABOUT THIS WORK:
This work is more about practising the structure of html(Hyper-text mark-up language) and css(Cascading style sheet). By making these forms i practised basic semantic elements and most importantly the basic structure, design, and layout of a form. Also entered inside of css, touched some animations(animated buttons, e..t.c). Really learnt a lot.
